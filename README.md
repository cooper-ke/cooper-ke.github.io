A project to keep track of availability for tutoring and other help for classes.

We use Google Forms to create a database of tutors, materials, and classes, then use that data for a
Python script that automatically generates websites that contain all of the relevant information
in the right places.

Find us at cooper-ke.github.io, or use the responses.csv file as a guide to create your own website.
